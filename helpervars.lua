walk_acceleration = 8
walk_acceleration_air = 8
min_speed = 0.7 -- Simulates static friction. If your speed falls below this you'll stop rather than slowly sliding
max_walk_speed = 6.4
friction = 14
friction_air = 0
air_control_multiplier = 0.8 -- How much acceleration to apply when trying to move backward mid air

gravity = 80
jumping_gravity = 30 -- Weaker than actual gravity so jumping feels less like a jetpack
jump_force = 16
